🏋️ SQL Fitness Tracker

Hey there 👋 This is my little project where I mixed two things I enjoy — fitness and data. I wanted to see how SQL could be used to track workouts, meals, and progress just like a real fitness app would.

🌟 What this project does

Keeps track of workouts (type, duration, calories burned).

Logs daily nutrition (meals, protein, carbs, fats).

Records progress over time (like weight changes and activity).

Lets me ask fun questions like:

“Which workout do I do most often?”

“How many calories do I burn on average each week?”

“Am I getting enough protein daily?”

🛠️ How I built it

Designed the database in MySQL Workbench.

Wrote tables for workouts, nutrition, and progress.

Added some sample data (so it feels real).

Built queries to turn raw data into insights.

🚀 Try it yourself

Clone this repo.

Open fitness_tracker.sql in MySQL Workbench (or your favorite SQL tool).

Run it → you’ll have the database ready.

Play around with queries, or add your own workout data!

💡 Why I made this

I’m learning SQL and data analytics, and instead of going with boring sample data, I thought: why not use something I care about? Fitness is a big part of my life, so building a fitness tracker with SQL felt like the perfect practice project.
